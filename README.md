Hello ðŸ˜Š

This is the beginning of a small Notes app

![Note app screenshot](https://github.com/Yexan/angular-test-project/blob/main/notes.png)

Here are the goals for today :
+ create the component for the notes list, for the note display
+ create a service to handle the state of the notes (list, current, add, remove)
+ Use the notes in the ts file provided
+ *Preferred* : Use behavior subject to display the currently displayed note (You can add a state to ask to click on a note if there is none, or choose to display by default the first one, as you prefer)
+ Add navigation on click in the note list and next / prev buttons
+ If you have remaining time :
  - add a delete button to delete a note in the list
  - add an add button to add a note


Don't worry if everything is not complete by the end of the hour
Have fun, see you soon ðŸŽ‰
